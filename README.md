# survey-form


A simple survey form mini project. This project happened to consist of only html and css. In the future for projects similar to this, I intend to include a lot of javascript to include functionalities like password matching.


I spent a lot of time learning about the different aspects of form creation. I also spent time reinforcing and relearning old concepts like webpage design. 

<strong><em>Features</em></strong>
-input validation
-selected input animation
-button hover animation
-form components
